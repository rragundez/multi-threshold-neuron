In the fully connected layer for example, the input signal for $j$ neurons comming from connected neurons $i$ is $\\sum_iW_{ji}\\cdot I_i$, which means we can calculate the input signal for all $j$ neurons with one simple matrix multiplication $W \\cdot I$ (given that $I$ is written as a $N\\times1$ matrix).\n",

I am ignorant about what are all the implications of this. I expect that it will be more difficult for individual neurons (or parts of the network) to address a specific feature, therefore reducing overfitting.
